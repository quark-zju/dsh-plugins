/**
 * Cost attribution for dsh-bill.
 *
 * The dashboard's other views answer "how much" — this one answers "on what".
 * A request's bill is split across the KINDS OF CONTENT that occupied its
 * context: tool output read in, the model's own past text, the system prompt,
 * terminal commands, what you actually typed.
 *
 * Three things make the split defensible rather than decorative:
 *
 *   - **It is a carry-forward bill, not a usage bill.** Every request pays for
 *     its whole context again, so a tool result read once keeps billing on
 *     every later request until it falls out of the window. Attributing per
 *     request and summing is what surfaces that.
 *   - **Position decides the rate, not an average.** Prefix caching means the
 *     first N prompt tokens are cache hits and the rest are fresh — and those
 *     rates differ by up to 156× on DeepSeek. Segments are walked in the exact
 *     order the provider sees them, so the cached prefix is charged at the
 *     cache rate and only the tail pays full price. Splitting a request's cost
 *     by a flat per-token average would move real money to the wrong rows.
 *   - **Only counts are kept.** Attribution runs at capture time against the
 *     live request; what is persisted is character counts and dollars per
 *     category, never prompt text.
 *
 * Token counts per segment are estimated from character share (the provider
 * reports one total, not a per-block breakdown), but the TOTAL is the real
 * billed number, so the columns always add up to the bill actually paid.
 *
