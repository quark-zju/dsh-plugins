/**
 * Host half of dsh-bill.
 *
 * Captures every model call through the `llm/stream` waterfall, prices it
 * immediately at its own timestamp (via `llm-pricing`: models.dev + OpenRouter
 * catalogues, DeepSeek peak/off-peak schedules, user overrides), keeps a
 * bounded in-memory ring, and persists to `$DSH_HOME/dsh-bill/records.jsonl`
 * (default `~/.dsh/...`, cwd-independent).
 *
 * Three outward surfaces, each optional, each degrading to nothing:
 *
 *   - `ctx.connection.rpc` channel `/dsh-bill` — the transport-independent
 *     request path the browser half prefers.
 *   - `POST /dsh-bill/api` on `webServer` — the same dispatch over plain HTTP,
 *     for a client generation without the RPC channel.
 *   - the `billTurns` session projection — per-turn cost, PUSHED to the client
 *     rather than polled (see `./projection.js`).
 *
 * The action vocabulary is shared by the first two:
 *
 *   { action: 'session-cost', sessionId }  → one session's totals + per-model
 *   { action: 'dashboard', rangeDays? }    → global KPI / per-model / timeline
 *   { action: 'fx' }                       → effective USD→CNY rate
 *
 * All monetary values are returned in USD (the pricing basis); the browser
 * converts to the user's chosen display currency with the served fx rate, so
 * switching currencies is instant and identical across every component.
 *
 * Fail-soft contract: this plugin declares NO hard dependency. Recording spend
 * is useful on its own — through the `bill_stats` tool, or simply so the
 * history is there when a UI is next mounted — so a headless assembly with no
 * HTTP carrier keeps the capture path instead of waiting forever for a service
 * it does not need. Persistence goes to the harness home rather than through
 * the DSH `fs` service, which resolves against the workspace: spend is one
 * store per machine, not one per project.
