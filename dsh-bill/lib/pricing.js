/**
 * Model pricing for dsh-bill.
 *
 * The catalogue, the name normalization, the DeepSeek peak/off-peak schedules
 * and the effective-date machinery all live in `llm-pricing` now; this module
 * is the adapter between that library and what the plugin stores:
 *
 *   - DSH reports its token buckets DISJOINTLY (`inputTokens` excludes the
 *     cache counts) and folds reasoning into `outputTokens`. Both are
 *     properties of the producer, not of the vendor, so `tokenCounts()`
 *     declares them to llm-pricing rather than leaving it to guess.
 *   - A record is priced at its own timestamp (`at`), so historical rows are
 *     never re-priced when a vendor changes rates or when the UTC hour moves
 *     DeepSeek between its peak and off-peak windows.
 *   - Plugin config `priceOverrides` become llm-pricing overrides, which
 *     outrank every catalogue.
 *
 * Currency handling stays here: llm-pricing is USD-internal (as is the whole
 * plugin API) and the plugin presents every amount — including each model's
 * base rate — in USD, so the USD→* table below is what the browser converts
 * with when the user picks another display currency.
 *
 * @module dsh-bill/pricing
