/**
 * Keep the bilingual README pair honest.
 *
 * A translated pair rots one side at a time: someone edits the language they
 * think in, ships, and the other half quietly describes an older plugin. The
 * failure is invisible to every other check — both files parse, both files
 * read fine, and only a reader of the *other* language ever finds out.
 *
 * So the pair carries a consistency record: the hash of each side as of the
 * last time a human confirmed the two say the same thing. Editing either side
 * changes its hash and fails `--check`; the fix is to bring the other side
 * along and re-record. This is the same device DSH's own packages use
 * (`README.i18n.yaml`), restated here so this repo needs no monorepo tooling.
 *
 * Hashes are git blob hashes computed directly — `sha1("blob <len>\0" + bytes)`
 * over the LF-normalised text — so they match `git hash-object` and can be
 * checked against a diff by hand, without this script needing git to exist.
 *
 *   node scripts/i18n-pair.mjs           # verify (exit 1 on drift)
 *   node scripts/i18n-pair.mjs --write   # re-record after translating
